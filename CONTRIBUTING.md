### Write automated tests

Currently Textinator is mostly tested manually, so we would be very grateful for any kinds of tests: unit tests, integration tests or interaction tests. Please open a GitHub issue, assign it a *testing* label and describe what kind of tests you are willing to do.

## Your First Code Contribution

We follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr). The approach can be summarized as follows:

1.  Fork the original repository to your own Github account
2.  Clone the project to your machine
3.  Create a branch locally with a descriptive name
4.  Commit changes to the branch
5.  Fix style issues reported by precommit.
6.  Commit again.
7.  Push changes to your fork
8.  Open a PR in the original repository and wait for a code review.
