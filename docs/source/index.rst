Welcome to Textinator's documentation!
======================================

**Textinator** is an open-source highly-customizable annotation tool for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The tool offers a web interface with a user-friendly UI and supports a number of NLP tasks out-of-the-box:

* Question Answering
* Question Answering with Complexity Ranking
* Named Entity Recognition
* Co-reference Resolution
* Machine Translation
* Text Classification

Textinator offers multiple levels of customization depending on the user's coding skills. For instance, one could define custom labels for any classification or marking task without any coding skills at all. [EXPAND FURTHER!]
