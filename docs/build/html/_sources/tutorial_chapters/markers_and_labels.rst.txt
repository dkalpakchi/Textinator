Markers & Labels
==================

If you want to annotate a task currently unsupported by Textinator or simply customize a new task, you will have to define custom units of annotation. Textinator supports such customized definitions through `Markers`. You need just a couple of things to define a basic `Marker`:

a) find a descriptive name that will be displayed for the annotators;
b) choose a color;
c) choose a shortcut for the marker __(optional)__;
d) choose a short nickname for the marker __(even more optional)__.
